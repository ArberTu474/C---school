// 7. It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices are
// not stable. If your company needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot simply
// use this yearâ€™s price as the cost of pencils 2 years from now. Because of
// inflation the cost is likely to be higher than it is today. Write a program
// to gauge the expected cost of an item in a specified number of years. The
// program asks for the cost of the item, the number of years from now that
// the item will be purchased, and the rate of inflation. The program then
// outputs the estimated cost of the item after the specified period. Have the
// user enter the inflation rate as a percentage, like 5.6 (percent). Your program
// should then convert the percent to a fraction, like 0.056, and should use a
// loop to estimate the price adjusted for inflation. (Hint: This is similar to com-
// puting interest on a charge card account, which was discussed in this chapter.)
