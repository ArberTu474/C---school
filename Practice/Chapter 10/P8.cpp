// Define a class called Odometer that will be used to track fuel and mileage
// for an automotive vehicle. Include private member variables to track the
// miles driven and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon. The
// class should have a constructor that initializes these values to zero. Include
// a member function to reset the odometer to zero miles, a member function
// to set the fuel efficiency, a member function that accepts miles driven for a
// trip and adds it to the odometerâ€™s total, and a member function that returns
// the number of gallons of gasoline that the vehicle has consumed since the
// odometer was last reset.
// Use your class with a test program that creates several trips with different
// fuel efficiencies.
